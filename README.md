## Spring Boot, MVC, Angular, and Database Connections with JPA Repositories

This repository contains the basic backend component for a fullstack web application, as well as its connection to a database, that I wrote for my job as a software developer. Note that the table contains columns for id, name, and email address, and the display for the separate angular application therefore adjusts accordingly based on that information.
